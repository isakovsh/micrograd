After the first step micrograd I tired to test and I got really bad result. I didn't why and I tried to find 
solution and rewrite the , copied Karpathy's code but still I couldn't find solution. And I asked Chat GPT😐 
and I found solution. The problem was learning rate was high(I used small data). 

Conclusion : I really understand learning rate how much importand for nn.
